Tie::Cache::LRU - A Least-Recently Used cache


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    tie %cache, 'Tie::Cache::LRU', 500;
    tie %cache, 'Tie::Cache::LRU', '400k'; #UNIMPLEMENTED

    # Use like a normal hash.
    
    $cache_obj = tied %cache;
    $current_size = $cache_obj->curr_size;
    
    $max_size = $cache_obj->max_size;
    $cache_obj->max_size($new_size);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an implementation of a least-recently used (LRU) cache keeping
the cache in RAM.

A LRU cache is similar to the kind of cache used by a web browser.
New items are placed into the top of the cache.  When the cache grows
past its size limit, it throws away items off the bottom.  The trick
is that whenever an item is -accessed-, it is pulled back to the top.
The end result of all this is that items which are frequently accessed
tend to stay in the cache.
